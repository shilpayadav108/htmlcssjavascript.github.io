<p class="tanz" font-family="arial" font-size:"23px">Introduction
Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do.<br> There are so many factors involved in the prediction – physical factors vs. physhological, rational and irrational behaviour, etc. <br>All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy.
<br><br>
Can we use machine learning as a game changer in this domain?<br> Using features like the latest announcements about an organization, their quarterly revenue results, etc., machine learning techniques have the potential to unearth patterns and insights we didn’t see before, and these can be used to make unerringly accurate predictions.<br>
n this article, we will work<br> with historical data about the stock prices of a publicly listed company.<br><br>
<p class="tanz"> We will implement a mix of machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock price of this company, starting with simple algorithms like averaging and linear regression, and then move on to advanced techniques like Auto ARIMA and LSTM.<br><br>
<br><br><br>
<p class="tanz">The core idea behind this article is to showcase how these algorithms are implemented.<br> I will briefly describe the technique and provide relevant links to brush up on the concepts as and when necessary.<br> In case you’re a newcomer to the world of time series, I suggest going through the following articles first:<br>
